# The name of this file shows the naming convention for source
# files in this directory. The file itself also serves another
# purpose -- we can skip all kinds of tests for errors related
# to missing files. It is easier this way.
#
# All files in this directory should use the form:
#
# [digit][digit].[name].[suffix]
#
# For example: 00.dummy.bashrc

# vim: syntax=sh
